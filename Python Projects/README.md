# Python Projects

## artifical intelligence sample project

A sample of a python project is created under the folder artifical intelligence. Within the folder, you will see a env folder along with a requirements.txt file and main.py file.

To run the python project, you must first run a virtual environment for python.

### Running a python virtual environment

1. Install venv using "pip3 install venv" in the terminal.
2. Since a virtual enviroment has already been created for the project, you just have to activate the environment
3. For mac/linux: In the terminal, type "source /env/bin/activate" to activate the virtual enviroment.
4. For Windows: In the terminal, type ".\env\Scripts\activate"
5. Once activated, install the requirements.txt file using "pip3 install requirements.txt"
6. You should now be able to run the main.py file.
