### How to use GitHub

1. Install Github Desktop
2. Under the current repository tab, select add followed by "Clone Repository"
3. Find the repo shared with you under 'yourusername'/NTU-NickivanTheMechanicalEngineerFromNUS and click clone
4. The repo should appear within the tab
5. Right click on the name from the Current repository tab and select "Open With Visual Studio Code". Yours might be different depending on which text editor/IDE you are using.
6. You can now edit your codes within the editor.
7. Before editing the codes, under the "Current Branch" tab, create a new branch. This is for version history and ensures that the main code does not get edited.
8. Name the branch with your name and what will the branch be working on.
9. Ensure that changes are left in main when creating new branch.
10. From here, you are now working on a cloned version of the main branch. Any edits on the codes done in your branch will not affect the main branch. Once the changes are done within the branch, you can push to allow the admin of the repo to merge the codes to the main branch.
11. Feel free to always commit your changes as you can always revert changes from the commits. If not, you will lose your changes when something screws up.
12. Pay me for this :)
